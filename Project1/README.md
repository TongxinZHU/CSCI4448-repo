### Comments:
 None, this project was pretty straightforward and we simply followed the 
design outlined in the slides.We took advantage of the IntelliJ IDE to code this project, from there we were able to organize our code into packages, which made the structure of our code more easily read.
We chose to make the eat/makeNoise Methods lowest in the class hierarchy
because they are the most specific. Since Animal/Feline/Pachyderm/Canine are never instantiated we 
decided to make them all abstract too. Cats also make a random noise each time you call them.
In order to run the code, just hit the green play button
in IntelliJ and it will print/create an output file with the desired results.
